# PiroEngine Dynamic Sound Support Module
# This module provides dynamic sound support for the PiroEngine.

# Define a class for managing dynamic sounds
class DynamicSoundManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sounds = {}  # Dictionary to store loaded sounds

    # Load a sound file and associate it with a unique identifier
    def load_sound(self, sound_id, sound_file):
        # Load the sound file and store it in the dictionary
        sound_data = load_sound_from_file(sound_file)
        self.sounds[sound_id] = sound_data

    # Play a loaded sound with a given sound_id
    def play_sound(self, sound_id):
        if sound_id in self.sounds:
            sound_data = self.sounds[sound_id]
            play_sound(sound_data)
        else:
            print("Sound with ID", sound_id, "not found.")

        else:
            print("Sound with ID", sound_id, "not found.")

    # Add more methods for controlling sound properties and effects as needed

# Load a sound from a file (function to be implemented)

    # Implement sound loading logic here

# Play a sound (function to be implemented)

# Stop a playing sound (function to be implemented)

# Example usage of the DynamicSoundManager
if __name__ == "__main__":

    audio_manager.play_sound("bg_music")

    # Play explosion sound effect
    audio_manager.play_sound("explosion")

    # Stop background music
