# DynamicSound.pis - Implementing Dynamic Sound Support in PiroEngine

# Define the DynamicSound class
class DynamicSound:
    private var soundFile: string
    private var volume: float
    private var pitch: float

    # Constructor to initialize sound attributes
    constructor(soundFile: string, volume: float, pitch: float):
        this.soundFile = soundFile
        this.volume = volume
        this.pitch = pitch

    # Method to play the dynamic sound
    method play():
        # Code to load and play the sound with specified volume and pitch
        # You can use PiroScript's built-in audio functions here

    # Method to stop the dynamic sound
    method stop():
        # Code to stop playing the sound

    # Method to set the volume of the dynamic sound
    method setVolume(newVolume: float):
        # Code to adjust the volume of the sound

    # Method to set the pitch of the dynamic sound
    method setPitch(newPitch: float):
        # Code to adjust the pitch of the sound

# End of DynamicSound class definition
