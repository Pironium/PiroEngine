# PiroScript (.pis) code for memory protection in PiroEngine

# Define a custom memory protection class

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    allocated_address = memory_protection.allocate_memory(1024)  # Allocate 1 KB of memory
    print("Allocated memory at address:", allocated_address)
    
    # Implement memory protection and unprotection as needed
